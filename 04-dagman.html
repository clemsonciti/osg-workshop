<h2>
Overview
</h2>
<p>In scientific computing, one may have to perform several computational tasks or data manipulations that are inter releted in some order. Workflow management systems help to deal with such tasks or data manipulations. DAGMan is one of the early workflow managment system developed for distributed high throughput computing. DAGMan (Directed Acyclic Graph Manager) handles computational jobs that are mapped as a directed acyclic graph. In this section, we will learn how to apply DAGMan to run a long time scale molecular dynmaics (MD) simulation.</p>
<h2>
Running Long Time Scale MD Simulation with DAGMAN
</h2>
<p>At present, the recomended execution time to run a jobs on OSG is about 2-3 hours. Jobs requiring more than 2-3 hours, need to be submitted with the restart files. Manually submitting small jobs repeatedly with restart files may not be practical in many situations. DAGMan offers an elegant and simple solution to run set of jobs. With the DAGMan script one could run a long time scale MD simulations of biomolecules.</p>
<p>In our example, we will break the MD simulation in four steps and run it through the DAGMan script. For the sake of simplicity, the MD simulations run only for few integration steps to consume less computational time but demonstrate the ability of DAGMan.</p>
<p>Say we have created four MD jobs: <em>A0</em>, <em>A1</em>, <em>A2</em> and <em>A3</em> that we want to run one after another and combine the results. This means that the output files from the job <em>A0</em> serves as an input for the job <em>A1</em> and so forth. The input and output dependencies of the jobs are such that they need to be progressed in a linear fashion: <em>A0–&gt;A1–&gt;A2–&gt;A3</em>. These set of jobs clearly represents an acyclic graph. In DAGMan language, job <em>A0</em> is parent of job <em>A1</em>, job <em>A1</em> is parent of <em>A2</em> and job <em>A3</em> is parent of <em>A4</em>. In DAGMan script, this is expressed as</p>
<pre><code>######DAG file######    #comment
Job A0 namd_run_job0.submit  #Job keyword, Job Name, Condor Job submision script.
Job A0 namd_run_job0.submit  #Job keyword, Job Name, Condor Job submision script.
Job A0 namd_run_job0.submit  #Job keyword, Job Name, Condor Job submision script.
Job A0 namd_run_job0.submit  #Job keyword, Job Name, Condor Job submision script.
PARENT A0 CHILD A1  #Inter Dependency between Job A0 and A1
PARENT A1 CHILD A2  #Inter Dependency between Job A1 and A2 
PARENT A2 CHILD A3  #Inter Dependency between Job A2 and A3</code></pre>
<p>The first four lines after the comment are the listing of the condor jobs<br />
with name assignment: A0, A1, A2 and A3. Here the condor job submit files are namd_run_job0.submit, namd_run_job1.submit… that run the individual MD simulations. The next three lines describe the inter relation among the four jobs.</p>
<p>The above DAGMan script and the neccessary files are available to the user by invoking the <em>tutorial</em> command.</p>
<pre><code>tutorial dagman-namd
cd tutorial-dagman-namd</code></pre>
<p>The directory “tutorial-dagman-namd” contains all the neccessary files. The file “linear.dag” is the DAGMan script. The files “namd_run_job0.submit, …” are the HTCondor script files that execute the files “namd_run_job0.sh,…”.</p>
<p>Now we submit the DAGMan script on OSG.</p>
<pre><code>$ condor_submit_dag linear.dag 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

</code></pre>
<p>We can check the job status, by typing</p>
<pre><code>$ condor_q username

-- Submitter: login01.osgconnect.net : &lt;192.170.227.195:48781&gt; : login01.osgconnect.net
 ID      OWNER            SUBMITTED     RUN_TIME ST PRI SIZE CMD               
1317646.0   username          10/30 17:27   0+00:00:28 R  0   0.3  condor_dagman     
1317647.0   username          10/30 17:28   0+00:00:00 I  0   0.0  namd_run_job0.sh  

2 jobs; 0 completed, 0 removed, 1 idle, 1 running, 0 held, 0 suspended</code></pre>
<p>We see two runing jobs. One is the dagman job which manages the execution of NAMD jobs. The other is the actual NAMD execution “namd_run_job0.sh”. Once the dag completes, you will see four .tar.gz files “OutFilesFromNAMD_job0.tar.gz, OutFilesFromNAMD_job1.tar.gz, OutFilesFromNAMD_job2.tar.gz, OutFilesFromNAMD_job3.tar.gz”. If the output files are not empty, the jobs are successfully completed. Of course, a through check up requires looking at the ouput results.</p>
<p>The example described above has simple inter relation among the jobs. DAGMan is capable of dealing with the acyclic graph jobs with complex inter relations. Also DAGMan can help with the resubmission of uncompleted portions of a DAG, when one or more nodes result in failure. Also several dags can be combined into a single dag.</p>
